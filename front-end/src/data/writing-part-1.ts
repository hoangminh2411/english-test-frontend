    <p>You should spend about 20 minutes on this task.</p>

    <p>You live in Ho Chi Minh City. You moved to Manchester to study English three months ago. You have just received an email from a friend of mine, Sara from London. Read part of her email below.</p>

    <div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">
        <p>....</p>
        <p>
            What's Manchester like? I bet the weather's not too good!<br>
            Have you still got that part-time job in the fast-food restaurant?<br>
            It must be a good way of speaking to new people and making friends.<br>
            What about the family you're staying with? Do you go out much in the evening?<br>
            I hope the English classes are going well.<br>
        </p>
        <p>................</p>
        <p>Sara</p>
    </div>

    <p>Write a reply to Sara. In your email, you have to describe Manchester and the weather there, tell her about your part-time job, the family you are staying with, and your activities in the evening, and finally you have to write about your English classes there.</p>

    <p>You should write at least 120 words.</p>`,
